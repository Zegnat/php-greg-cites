# Silly Little HTML Citations

Citations are annoying to write at the best of times, even more so within HTML.

This thing tries to map BibTeX records, like those obtained from Google Scholar, to nice
copy-paste-able HTML snippets. These HTML snippets also include microformats2 [h-cite][]
objects, so the citations can also be extracted from the HTML.
